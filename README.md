- Environmental monitoring system

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/carbon-capture.git

# Install dependencies
cd carbon-capture
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration
1. Set environment variables in `.env`:
    - `DEVICE_API_KEY`: Hardware access
    - `MONITORING_KEY`: Sensor data
    - `VERIFICATION_KEY`: Audit access
    - `IMPACT_API_KEY`: Assessment tools

2. Configure system parameters in `config.js`:
    - Capture thresholds
    - Credit criteria
    - Verification requirements
    - Impact metrics

## Usage

### Device Management
```javascript
// Example of registering capture device
await captureDevice.registerDevice(
    deviceId,
    specifications,
    location,
    capacity
);
```

### Credit Generation
```javascript
// Example of issuing carbon credits
await creditIssuance.generateCredits(
    captureAmount,
    verificationProof,
    timestamp,
    location
);
```

### Sequestration Verification
```javascript
// Example of verifying storage
await sequestrationVerification.verifyStorage(
    storageId,
    carbonAmount,
    method,
    duration
);
```

### Impact Tracking
```javascript
// Example of generating impact report
await impactAssessment.generateReport(
    timeframe,
    location,
    metrics,
    parameters
);
```
